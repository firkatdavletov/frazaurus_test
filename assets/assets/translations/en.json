    "introduction_content": "Welcome to Frazaurus! I am Timofey Mineev, its author. Allow me to briefly introduce this application.\n\nFrazaurus, an interpreter’s concise idiomatic thesaurus (ICIT), represents a collection of Russian and English free and idiomatic set expressions, sayings, and catchwords with relevant analogues and equivalents in the counterpart language. The ICIT builds on the practical aspects of simultaneous interpreting and was designed primarily for interpreters working with the relevant language pair who may have interest in such linguistic entities and difficulty rendering them.\n\nNow, Frazaurus encompasses only a small portion of such phrases and focuses on the principles that would lay the groundwork for a future expansion of this corpus. For this reason, the ICIT cannot be referred to as a complete collection of idioms or, by extension, set expressions — which isn’t its end. So, I called it a concise thesaurus. \n\nI have been working on the ICIT from 2018 to 2022 collecting over a thousand phrases in each of the two languages. The core principle of this dictionary is to link set expressions based on their semantic equivalence. Frazaurus lists only those units that have a potential lexeme in the target language with a similar meaning.\n\nOther distinctive features of the ICIT include a stylistic gradation of idiomatic analogues in the target language, the literal translation of source-language phrases, as well as their connotative translation.\n\nBy way of disclaimer, all the analogues and suggested translations pursue academic and communicative goals only, i.e. to convey, as much as possible, the meanings of Russian and English expressions in the other language. \n\nI hope you will enjoy many features of Frazaurus that may prove useful in your work. Good luck!",
    "how_to_use_content": "The list of units in the Interpreter’s Concise Idiomatic Thesaurus (ICIT) follows alphabetical order. The units are sorted by their head words, or core components, whereas secondary variable elements are provided in brackets for clarification on the idiom’s contextual use. The secondary element has a weaker connection with the core component and may be employed, changed or omitted depending on the context. The head words were chosen based on the semantic and ordinal criteria, i.e. the most influential word, or a collocation with the strongest connection was used with the first word as the head word. It’s not uncommon for the core component to show variability. (e.g., “hard/tough row to hoe”). Considering the intended brevity of the ICIT, whenever possible, the most frequent expression was picked from a range of synonyms as confirmed by Google Ngram Viewer. \n\nAt this stage, ICIT units in the source and target languages are provided with notes on their style and, occasionally, origin, regional characteristics or typical area of use. Such notes are used for semanticization in order to better categorize expressions. \n\nThe ICIT was created for translators, interpreters, linguists and general users who have a sufficient knowledge of the Russian and English grammar and phonetics. It presumes, inter alia, the ability to read and pronounce lexical units in accordance with the applicable orthoepic norms. For this reason, lexemes have no stress marks except for deviations required by the traditions of use. This also concerns the omission of articles in English phrases, nominal groups, other than those which denote the only possible variant. The given grammatical characteristics are restricted to the units’ distinctive features and/or their deviations from a norm. \n\nSometimes it proves very difficult to determine the style of set expressions, especially proverbs, within the traditional limits of the formal language. In order to select the stylistic registers of lexemes, several criteria were employed. Firstly, we build upon the findings of other dictionaries when they are unanimous in determining a unit’s style. However, all too often, different sources assign different qualities to the phrase in question, especially when it lies “above” or “below” the neutral layer of vocabulary. Plus, hardly every idiom can be found in modern dictionaries with its stylistic register specified. \n\nAs the style of many set expressions often remains blurred, instead of absolute register markers characterizing a target-language expression regardless of its context, a relative ranking system was used. It allows distributing idiomatic analogues in the target language between hierarchical levels in relation to the considered lexical unit in the source language. In general, as described above, multiple factors were taken into account in order to stylistically categorize the ICIT’s lexemes and sort their idiomatic analogues by levels, with the author’s subjective opinion, among others, playing a big part. \n\n As the style of many set expressions often remains blurred, instead of absolute register markers characterizing a target-language expression regardless of its context, a relative ranking system was used.

In general, as described above, multiple factors were taken into account in order to stylistically categorize the ICIT’s lexemes and sort their idiomatic analogues by levels, with the author’s subjective opinion, among others, playing a big part. \n\nLanguage users tend to assign their own interpretations to different expressions as a part of their idiolects. Such a perspective doesn’t always correspond to a generally accepted opinion or definitions given by dictionaries. The connotative equivalents of lexical units were formulated and their idiomatic analogues in the target language were selected with the same extent of subjectivity. In addition, all literal translations in the ICIT were also provided by its author, except for the cases where the authorship was additionally specified in brackets. \n\nTarget-language analogues are grouped on the basis of their semantic aspects which they share with a source-language unit. Considering polysemy, some LUs bring together several groups of analogues and thus are provided with multiple connotative equivalents . These groups may, however, coincide only to some degree or not coincide at all. If the semes of a LU partly match that of an idiomatic analogue, the analogue is marked as “context.” (contextual equivalence), i.e. the suggested analogue can be used as a translation of the LU in a certain context only while having other meanings too. Additionally, set expressions can be employed with varying connotations, literally or figuratively, etc. In this case, ICIT units were sometimes marked with “may be.” \n\nThere also are source-language units that have no immediate semantic analogue in the target language. However, these sometimes have relevant target-language counterparts offering lexical and/or syntactic similarity with a different meaning. In such cases, the target-language expression was subjected to a slight transformation in order to be fit for use as an idiomatic equivalent of the lexical unit at hand. The occasional formations of this sort were included in the ICIT with enclosing quotation marks (“”) as an indication that there’s no such codified unit in the target language. \n\nNevertheless, not every unit may or should be conveyed using a pseudo-idiom. For this reason, almost all source-language lexemes in the ICIT have a literal translation which makes Frazarus stand out from many other dictionaries and collections. However, the literal translation is missing if a source-language idiom has a lexical, syntactical and semantical equivalent in the target language, e.g. in the case of the same origin. Nor is it provided when an expression could not be possibly broken down into components. There are some obsolete forms whose roots and original meaning could not be traced, in which case a literally translated equivalent is omitted too. \nThe units selected for the ICIT were thoroughly considered from the viewpoint of their modern use. Frazaurus includes only units with recorded oral or written use at least in the 20th century as found in text corpora. To search such instances, I used the following tools: the National Russian Language Corpora for Russian, the search system TheFreeLibrary, its “Periodicals” section, for English, and the search engine Google, its sections “News” and “Books” for both languages, Google Ngram Viewer, as well as my personal experience as a translator and interpreter. A phrase was included in the ICIT if its use was confirmed by at least one source. It was acceptable for a modern Russian expression to have a dated English counterpart. This provides at least a minimum idiomatic correspondence. It is quite different if both a Russian and an English expression were dated and have confirmed use examples, for instance, only in the sources of the 19th century. In this case, it is unlikely to encounter and, hence, to use any of them. The mentioned pairs were therefore not included in Frazaurus.",

Plus, hardly every idiom can be found in modern dictionaries with its stylistic register specified.\n\nBecause of limited dictionary capacities, the ultimate choice was driven by real cases of use which can be found in text corpora and publications available through search engines. It was the use of a lexical unit in speech that represented the main criterion for determining its register. If such an investigation failed to clearly ascertain stylistic characteristics, then the unit’s lexical and syntactic composition was considered. This aspect reveals minor nuances which distinguish, for instance, a high-style idiom from a similarly elevated expression but belonging to the domain of verbal communication.\n\nAs the style of many set expressions often remains blurred, instead of absolute register markers characterizing a target-language expression regardless of its context, we used a relative stylistic gradation of idiomatic analogues in the target language: from high to low if such analogues are found. It allows distributing idiomatic analogues in the target language between hierarchical levels in relation to the considered lexical unit in the source language. This technique enables both the closest render of the original style of the source lexical unit as well as stylistic modulation for changing a translation register depending on the context.

To this end, Frazaurus employs a number of brief syntactic formulas. Using such a connotative equivalent, an interpreter can quickly fill a communication gap while reducing the time of lag from the speaker by compression. ",
